# W4MP1DUDL3's Heli Training Guide

### Preface
This training guide is intended for anybody that wants to learn or become better at, flying in the game of SQUAD. In terms of current skill level this guide has the capability to extend to both ends of the spectrum. From the most basic helicopter physics to meta-level stategies for pilots every tiopic is goping to be covered extensively, so feel free to jump arround and read whatever seems new to you. Should you decide to follow the guide from the very beginning, you will learn everything needed to become one of the most consistend and well trained individuals in the SQUAD playerbase.

## Chapter 1: Basic Helicopter Terminology and Physics <a name="ch1"></a>
The physics of flight have long been studied and can be summarized as follows. For anything to be considered flying the force of lift must be grater than or equal to the force of gravity. Conventionally, with airplanes that lift is gained through the use of wings with an specific cross section. Said cross section is what we refer to as an airfoil. Similarly the rotors or our helicopter have that same cross section. If you are interested in the physics behind how an airfoil creates lift check out:________ . All we need to know at this moment is that in order to increase the lift generated by an airfoil you either (Newton) need to increase the angle of attack or increase the airspeed of the wind traveling around the foli (Bernouli).

In our case since a helicopter controls the amount of lift by angling the blades. This is what is reffered to as "collective". The term "collective" comes from the mechanics that is used to control the pitch of the rotor blades. Going even further into this area of knowledge would probably exhasut a full chapter so feel free to check out the following video for some more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xairCL9m9ec. Physically, the colelctive is always going to be your left hand. The three other controls that remain to be explained are pitch, roll and yaw.

As depicted in the above figure, if we lay a simple 3D coordinate system into our helicopter, then rotation of the helicopter about its y-axis is considered pitch and rotation about the x-axis is considered roll. Physically, these are controlled by the joystick in your right hand and are reffered to as you "cyclic". AS you might have noticed in the video linked above, this is controlled by the actuation of the "swashpate". This is a relatively fancy and complex bearing that allows us to manipulate a set of rotors to adjust the direction that the lift vector points to.

Naturally, becasue of the existance of friction, a helicopter without the use of a back rotor would start spining coaxially aroundf the z-axis since the torgue exerted by the trubine onto the main rotor is not counteracted. For theis very purpose do we require a back rotor. Adjusting the strngth with which it generates thurst (also a type of collective) is considererd "yaw control". Its puropose besides counteracting the torque created by the turbine, is also to allow the rotation about the z-axis.

## Chapter 2: In-game Flight Controls <a name="ch2"></a>
Fight controls are something that varies greatly from game to game. The default controls set out by the devs are as follows. While pitch and roll are controlled by your mouse on the y- and x-axes respectively, collective is set on "W" and "S" and yaw control is "A" and "D". The general consensous amongst very skilled and seasioned pilots is clear: default controls are simply put not enough to become proficient. Flying in squad is easily the best example of "easy to learn but hard to master" seeing as manuevers can be learnt swiftly but becoming consistent is by far the hardest thing in this game while jointly being the key to proficiency. In order to become consistent at flying one must limit all possible factors that could lead to deviations while flying certain manuevers. SHould you want ot follwo this guide to a tee please adjust the following controls in your settings:

Subsequntly, be sure to change the bind for enginge ignition. Personally I have set mine to "I" for "Ignition". The setting can be found under the "Ground Vehicles" tab.
